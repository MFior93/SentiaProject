I know that it's not a best way to deploy everything via the CLI and I could make full automate ARM templates , but of course it needs more 
time and get more deeply into it , because i was working mostly via the Portal and only with my company , so it's not like production :) 
It's not a problem for me but i know that it's taking some time . 

Please let me know if i should focus on the Policies after my travel to Poland . 

I would like to work in this kind of work , because i know that it can be a good opportunity for me to develop my skills and focus
only on this , instead of management job :)
