I haven't play with policies even in my current job so i think that i will need some more time to think about it and make it . 

I made an policy for ResourceTypes but it's working other way around : 

{
  "mode": "all",
  "policyRule": {
    "if": {
      "not": {
        "field": "type",
        "in": "[parameters('listOfResourceTypesAllowed')]"
      }
    },
    "then": {
      "effect": "deny"
    }
  },
  "parameters": {
    "listOfResourceTypesAllowed": {
      "type": "Array",
      "metadata": {
        "displayName": "Allowed resource types",
        "description": "The list of resource types that can be deployed.",
        "strongType": "resourceTypes"
      },
      "allowedValues": [
        "Microsoft.Compute",
        "Microsoft.Network",
        "Microsoft.Storage"
      ]
    }
  }
}

When i assign the policy and check the boxes for Compute , Network or Storage it's blocking them . 
I assume that it's because in the "effect" line there is "DENY" and i need to make more research about it how to revert it . 

Assigning the policy via the portal is very easy and i did that before .
